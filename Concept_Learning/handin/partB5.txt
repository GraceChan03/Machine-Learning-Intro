5. What did you observe, and how well did your program do? What, if anything, can you learn from this?
After using the data in 4Cat-Dev.labeled to check the version space I created, I found that it did not show specific result. The vote fell half on high and half on low. So I cannot make conclusion based on the result from the algorithm. I think that it may be the result of lack of sufficient training data. Since the version space is created by excluding hypothesis inconsistent with training data set, the insufficiency of training data leads to the unreliability of the version space.
